Dublin City Marathon 2017
-------------------------
Project using Dublin City Marathon data for 3 years to show Python, Pandas, and Seaborn visualisations in use.

Two jupyter notebooks:
MArathon Web Scraper: 	scrapes results of marathons from website tdleventservices.co.uk
			Source data includes time splits (10km, Half, 30km, Final) as well as gender and age information.

			note: need to change path, number of pages, and year depending on Race Results you are looking for


Marathon Review:	Visualises various interpretations of the Marathon Resultset over the three years
			note: uses the results collected from the Marathon Web Scraper for three years: 2015, 2016, 2017
			note: for the purpose of this analysis, rows are removed for racers who did not complete / did not have an interval time
